# Artix Linux
This guide is about Artix Linux, an Arch-based distro without systemd, and installing it on a USB 3.0 Drive.
The key difference is that it's supposed to use less I/O to keep the flash storage healthy and not block anything else.  

## Goals
I want to use this as a light Linux install for troubleshooting and development on the go:
* Artix Linux with OpenRC
* btrfs for the main file system (only FAT32 for UEFI-Boot, no Swap)
* Installing SDDM, LXQt and i3 and theming it
* Configuring XOrg, ALSA and Pipewire and XTerm
* Configuring Neovim as a terminal IDE
* Code-OSS and language SDKs for development as well as Git
* Brave as a privacy-friendly browser

# Installing the base system
WIP.
