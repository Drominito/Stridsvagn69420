# Void Linux
Currently, this guide is empty and only serves as a placeholder since this is still WIP.

## Goals
The system is meant to be installed on a USB 3.0 Flashdrive. I chose Void since any Disk IO can slow down the entire system in this case. I want this to be a portable and lightweight Linux install for developement and troubleshooting while (at least technically) allowing you to extend the install, e.g. with an actual DE like Xfce. Thus my goals for this Guide are:
* Set up Install Void Linux
* Install LightDM and awesome
* Theme [xterm](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/xterm), [awesome](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/awesome) and the general system with colors, shapes, fonts, etc.
* Install and configure Neovim for TTY-only situations
* Install Git, GPG, VSCode, Rust, Go and Brave as well as some utilities
* Use Pipewire and ALSA for Audio
