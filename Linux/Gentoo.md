# Gentoo Linux
This guide will help you install the most epic Linux-chad system, I think. I use Arch, btw.

## Goals
* Compile Gentoo and install the base system
* Configure X.Org and install dwm along with st
* Theme the WM
* Install Neovim
* Install SDKs to develop on the system
* Download more things to completely daily-drive the system
